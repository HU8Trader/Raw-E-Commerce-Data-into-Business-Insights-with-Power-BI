# Raw-E-Commerce-Data-into-Business-Insights-with-Power-BI
E-Commerce Sales Dashboard in Power BI to turn raw sales data into meaningful, actionable insights.
📊 What I started with:
The dataset had product information, pricing, discounts, taxes, shipping costs, customer demographics, and geographic details.

⚙️ What I built with DAX:

Total Sales & Orders

Revenue (No Discount) vs Final Sales

Revenue Loss due to Discounts

Weighted Avg Discount %

Tax & Shipping Impact measures

🌍 Key Visuals in the Dashboard:

Executive Summary KPIs → Sales, Revenue, Discount Loss, Avg Discount %, Shipping Cost

Trend Analysis → Revenue vs Discount % relationship

Product Analysis → Category-wise sales performance with orders, stock & return rate

Regional Insights → Shipping % of order value and tax impact by geography

Discount Distribution → Orders segmented by discount bucket

💡 Business Value:

Quickly identify high-discount categories eating into revenue

Compare regional shipping & tax impact on profitability

Visualize product performance & stock alignment

Provide data-backed recommendations for pricing and discount strategies

This dashboard is designed to meet international BI standards with clean visuals, business-first KPIs, and storytelling-driven structure.

✨ Power BI isn’t just about making charts – it’s about uncovering the “why” behind the numbers.
This project helped me demonstrate how structured DAX measures + thoughtful visuals can deliver clarity and confidence to business decisions.
